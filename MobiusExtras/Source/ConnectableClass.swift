/// the `handle`, `onConnect`, and `onDispose` functions.
///
/// This class automatically handles creation of `Connection`. Any subclass can override any of the following functions:
///   - `handle`: this function handles any input (i.e. T.Effects). If a `T.Event` is should be sent to the loop,
///      it should be passed to the `send` function which will pass it to the Mobius loop
///
///   - `onConnect`: this function is called when the connection is being established. It can be used to allocate and
///     initialize any resources used by the subclass.
///
///   - `onDispose`: this function is called when the loop has disposed of the `Connectable`. Any resources used by the
///     subclass should be freed here. When this function is called, the base class has already released all its
///     resources so no further functions should be run on the base class.
