/// An `EffectRouter` defines the relationship between the effects in your domain and the constructs which handle those
/// effects.
///
/// - Note: Each effect in your domain must be linked to exactly one handler. A runtime crash will occur if zero or
/// multiple handlers were found for some received input.
///
/// To define the relationship between an effect and its handler, you need two parts. The first is the routing criteria.
///  There are two choices here:
///  - `.routeEffects(equalTo: constant)` - Routing to effects which are equal to `constant`.
///  - `.routeEffects(withParameters: extractParameters)` - Routing effects that satisfy
///     a parameter extracting function: `(Effect) -> EffectParameters?`. If this function returns a non-`nil` value,
///     that route is taken and the non-`nil` value is sent as the input to the route.
///
/// These two routing criteria can be matched with one of four types of targets:
///  - `.to { effect in ... }`: A fire-and-forget style function of type `(EffectParameters) -> Void`.
///  - `.toEvent { effect in ... }`: A function which returns an optional event to send back into the loop:
///    `(EffectParameters) -> Event?`. This makes it easy to send a single event caused by the effect.
///  - `.to(EffectHandler)`: This should be used for effects which require asynchronous behavior or produce more than
///     one event, and which have a clear definition of when an effect has been handled. For example, an effect handler
///     which performs a network request and dispatches an event back into the loop once it is finished or if it fails.
///  - `.to(Connectable)`: This should be used for effect handlers which do not have a clear definition of when a given
///     effect has been handled. For example, an effect handler which will continue to produce  events indefinitely once
///     it has been started.
