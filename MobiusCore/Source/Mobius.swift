/// A wrapper around an update function.
///
/// The [update function] is the core of a Mobius loop. It takes a model and an event, and produces an updated model and
/// a list of effects.
///
/// The Update function is declarative, in the sense that it declares what should happen, but doesn’t actually do
/// anything itself. It returns a `Next` that describes the desired changes – possibly a new `Model`, and possibly some
/// `Effect`s that should be executed – but actually changing the `Model` and executing the `Effect`s happens elsewhere.
///
/// The `Update` struct is intended to simplify compositional construction of update functions, but Mobius itself
/// doesn’t currently provide any utilities for this kind of workflow. It is possible to pass a plain function (of type
/// `(Model, Event) -> Next<Model, Effect>` to the Mobius loop instead of explicitly creating an `Update` struct.
